**spfind** is a simple file search tool. It tries to give you something
similar to Windows' **Everything**.

It just implements the core functions of **Everything**, and depends on
external tools to produce database for it, so it may not behave realtime.

This project may not be continued in development for more features.
For similar and more advanced functions, please refer to
**[BookMate](https://github.com/chunis/bookmate)**.
Still, I'll make this tool useful in the coming days.
